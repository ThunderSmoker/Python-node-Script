# Node.js Setup

Node.js Setup is a Python package that automates the setup process for a Node.js project. It creates the necessary files and directories, installs dependencies, and sets up a basic Node.js server.

## Installation

You can install Node.js Setup using pip:
   ```pip install node-thunder```


## Usage

After installing Node.js Setup, you can run the `node-thunder` command to set up your Node.js project. Here's how you can use it:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory where you want to create your nodejs project.
3. Run the following command: `node-thunder`



This command will create the required files and directories, install dependencies, and set up a basic Node.js server.

## Configuration

Node.js Setup uses a `.env` file for configuration. You can modify the `.env` file to customize the port and MongoDB URI used by the server. By default, the server runs on port 5000 and connects to a MongoDB database running locally.

## Project Structure

After running `node-thunder`, your project directory will have the following structure:

models/
routes/
controllers/
db/
.env
.gitignore
connect.js
app.js


- The `models/` directory is for storing your MongoDB models.
- The `routes/` directory is for defining your Express routes.
- The `controllers/` directory is for implementing your route handlers.
- The `db/` directory is for database-related files.
- The `.env` file contains the configuration variables for the server.
- The `.gitignore` file specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by version control.
- The `connect.js` file establishes the connection to the MongoDB database.
- The `app.js` file is the entry point for your Node.js server.

`npm start` command starts the server with nodemon

Feel free to modify and extend the project structure to suit your needs.
